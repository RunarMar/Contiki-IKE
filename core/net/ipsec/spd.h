  *
  * Datastructure for encoding SA offers
  *
  * The structure below is used for encoding the SA proposals as described in section 3.3 in RFC 5996.
  * As you see, the tuples consists of a \b type and a \b value. The former describes the type of later, for example;
  *   <SA_TRANSFORM_TYPE_ENCR, SA_ENCR_AES_CBC> (that is, encryption algorithm is of type SA_ENCR_AES_CBC)
  * One now realises that theses tuples can be used to represent the tree structure of an SA offer (see p. 76). The proposals
  * are ordered by preference in descending order.
  *
  * Writing a proper grammar for the "offer tree" is tedious, but below you'll find a set of rules that express
  * almost the same. There should also be examples to look at in spd_conf.c.
  *
  * ===Tail token===                                          ===Token(s) that can be appended===
  *
  * EMPTY ARRAY                                         ->    <SA_CTRL_NEW_PROPOSAL, any sa_ipsec_proto_type_t>
  * <SA_CTRL_NEW_PROPOSAL, any sa_ipsec_proto_type_t>   ->    <SA_CTRL_TRANSFORM_*, anything applicable to the given type>
  * <SA_CTRL_TRANSFORM_TYPE_ENCR, *>                    ->    <SA_CTRL_ATTRIBUTE_KEY_LEN, *>
  * <SA_CTRL_END_OF_OFFER, *>                           ->    END OF ARRAY
  * < not SA_CTRL_NEW_PROPOSAL, *>                      ->    <SA_CTRL_NEW_PROPOSAL, any sa_ipsec_proto_type_t>
  * < *, *>                                             ->    <SA_CTRL_END_OF_OFFER, *> 
  *                   (parse above rule set top-down as some set selectors overlap)
  *
  * Now, despite manuals, we all make mistakes. Therefore I've elected to list a few common ones so that you can avoid them:
  *   -> SA_CTRL_NEW_PROPOSAL must be followed by one or more transforms.
  *   -> The array must always end with SA_CTRL_END_OF_OFFER.
  *   -> The proposals should be ordered in 
  *
  * An array of such tuples ordered with respect to the above invariants will form a parseable proposal. Please
  * note that there are more constraints which need to be taken into consideration in order to craft a valid set of
  * SA proposals. For example; it doesn't make sense to include an encryption transform in an AH-proposal. Therefore 
  * it's recommended that you read section 3.3 before crafting your own proposals.
  *
  * The struct is two bytes large and the compiler won't insert any padding.
